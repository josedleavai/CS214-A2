## Introduction
This Java program solves instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using two algorithms: Dynamic Programming and a Genetic Algorithm. It also performs empirical testing to evaluate the performance of these algorithms.

## Files
- `source.java`: Main program file containing the application's entry point and user interface.
- `TSPDP.java`: Dynamic Programming algorithm implementation.
- `TSPGA.java`: Genetic Algorithm implementation.
- `EmpiricalTesting.java`: Empirical testing class.
- `Performance.java`: JavaFX application for racing the algorithms.
- `*.atsp` files: Sample TSP instance files.

## Getting Started
To run the program, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1. Compile the program

2. Run the program

## Usage
1. The program will prompt you to choose a `.atsp` file containing a TSP instance.

2. Once a file is selected, you can choose from the following options:
- **Dynamic Programming for TSP**: Solves the TSP using Dynamic Programming.
- **Genetic Algorithm for TSP**: Solves the TSP using a Genetic Algorithm.
- **Empirical Testing**: Evaluates the performance of both algorithms.
- **Race The Algorithms for TSP**: Launches a JavaFX application to race the algorithms.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each option.

## Sample Input Files
The program includes sample `.atsp` files in the repository for testing purposes.

## Additional Notes
- The program displays results, including best tour and distance, for each algorithm.
- Empirical testing provides statistics on algorithm performance.
- The "Race The Algorithms" option visualizes the algorithms' execution.
